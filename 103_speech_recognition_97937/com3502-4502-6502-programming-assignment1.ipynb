    "This programming assignment is worth 55% of the overall course mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to complete this assignment in your own time. However, feedback, advice and guidance is available during the lab classes and via the discussion board on Blackboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Via these channels we try to help you as much as possible, but will not debug your code or provide solutions to the assignment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It will take some time to complete this assignment, so plan your work accordingly over the coming weeks. Read these instructions carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please be aware that students registered on COM4502 and COM6502 have **additional tasks** to perform. These are marked ‘COM4502-6502 Only’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You should always ensure that your results (e.g. in terms of plots you create) are clear to undrestand and leave no room for mis-interpretation. This can often easily achieved by adding proper $x$- and $y$-axis labels, titles, legends etc. Where results are not clear to interprete, this might result in missed points. \n"
